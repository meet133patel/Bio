			<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
			<h3><strong>Project Overview:</strong></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>In the fast growing field of software engineering and development and even more rapidly growing sector of game development the future is hard to predict. We are working with this game and as part of our degree we choose this type of work for doing better with development cycle, development period, graphics, scripting, adopting new technology, animation. In general software project is a project focusing on the creation of software. Consequently, Success can be measured by taking a look at the resulting software. In a game project, the product is a game. But and here comes the point: A game is much more than just its software. It has to provide content to become enjoyable. Just like a web server without content the server is useless, and the quality cannot be measured. This has an important effect on the game project as a whole. The software part of the project is not the only one, and it must be considered in connection to all other parts: The environment of the game, models, game plays, the artwork, and so on.</li>
					</ul>
			<h5><strong>Unity:</strong></h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Unity is a cross platform game engine with its own built in IDE which allows for development of either 2D or 3D games. Unity is primarily used to create games for a variety of platforms such as web, desktop, consoles and most recently, mobile platforms.</li>
						<li>Unity is the primary tool that was used to create this project. It was chosen primarily because of the fact that it is free to use and has a vast amount of support available from the community including an asset store from which some free assets can be added to a project in order to enhance it as well as saving time and money.</li>
						<li>Unity features a main scene view which displays the visual elements of the project such as the terrains, models, etc. Any object that is used in Unity, whether it’s a terrain, a shape, a model, is referred to as a GameObject. These game objects can be modified using the Inspector view. With the Inspector view you can see the transform, rotation and scale information of the selected GameObject. You can also see the scripts that the object is using and the components attached to it.</li>
						<li>Unity offers support for assets that are created in a wide variety of file formats, such as fbx. Assets created in other programs can simply be added to a game project in Unity by choosing them from the saved location on your computer. Unity makes adding imported art assets to the game scene as simple as drag and drop in the desired location.</li>
						<li>Unity’s scripting is based primarily on MonoDevelop which is an open source implementation within the .Net framework. When working with Unity, you are given the option of using JavaScript or C#. Unity makes use of MonoDevelop, though developers are free to use whatever scripting tool they desire.</li>
						<li>Unity supports project deployment on multiple platforms. When a project is finished, developers can choose which platform they would like their project to run on, e.g. PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Window, Linux, Android, IOS and many others. We are currently using Unity version 2018.2.2in the development of our game.</li>
						
					</ul>
					
			<h5><strong>Unity Asset Store:</strong></h5>
					<ul>
					<p>The asset store is a resource that is located within the Unity editor and is also available online. The store currently consists of thousands of packages which are divided into sections such as environments, characters, textures/materials etc. that are available to developers to use within their projects. They can be free or paid, depending on the level of work involved in the asset. Without the asset store, all the objects in the game would have to be created manually in a program such as blender and would become extremely time consuming. The asset store was used for all the models and some other websites.</p>
					</ul>
			<h5><strong>MonoDevelop:</strong></h5>
					<ul>
						<p>MonoDevelop is an IDE which is installed with Unity 3D. It allows you to create and edit C# and JavaScript files used in the game. It differs from the standard IDE because it has in-built functions and auto-completion with coding specifically relating to Unity. MonoDevelop is able to interact with the GameObjects used in Unity. It can access their co-ordinates, scripts attached to them, their tags, etc. These are very useful in creating powerful scripts. It also allows variables to be edited from Unity so changes do not need to be made in the scripts every time. This made it really easy to test different things in my game as I could easily change variables such as distance or try different images or sound clips. Errors that appear within the IDE are also shown in the Unity Debugging Window which recompiles regularly. Double clicking the error will bring you to the line of code in the script that is causing the problem.</p>
						
					</ul>
			<h5><strong>C#:</strong></h5>
					<ul>
					<p>C# is a modern programming language which allows developers to create applications which will then run on the .NET framework. I had been introduced to C# in one of my modules in college which is a reason Unity was chosen. As I had been introduced to C# in college I was familiar with it and it made it that bit easier when trying to fix problems in scripts.</p>
					</ul>
			<h5><strong>JavaScript:</strong></h5>
					<ul>
						<p>JavaScript is a multi-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to allow programmatic control over them. </p>
						
					</ul>
	
			<h3><strong>Project Definition:</strong></h3>
					<ul>
						<p>Unity is a multiplatform game engine that supports 2D and 3D graphics. Games were commonly scripted in C# and UnityScript, similar to JavaScript, which makes them much easier to understand. Earlier people only played games on consoles or computers until now people are more willing to play games on mobile phones. So there are lot of educational apps in market for educational purpose. The app’s focus has a strong connection to the KIDS which are bad at mathematics. Also one of the most important subject is mathematics itself. We are going to enhance learning basic by Starting from basics and to higher level like VEDIC mathematics.</p>
					</ul>
			
			<h3><strong>Purpose:</strong></h3>
					<ul>
						<p>In recent years, game industries have entered a stage of rapid development. Also exporting to android version is easy also app will be playable in AR/VR environment on PC as well as mobile supported devices. Majorly Kids will be using this app. More different types of games have appeared on a variety of new platforms, because relatively low cost and huge profits have motivated more people to get involved in this area. . In general software project is a project focusing on the creation of software. Consequently, Success can be measured by taking a look at the resulting software. In a game project, the product is a game. But and here comes the point: A game is much more than just its software. It has to provide content to become enjoyable.</p>
					</ul>
			
			<h3><strong>Objective:</strong></h3>
					<ul>
						<p>The app’s focus has a strong connection to the KIDS which are bad at mathematics. Many mathematics type game are already available in Play Store. But they are limited to some portion only like addition type basic operations. We are going to enhance learning basic by Starting from basics and to higher level like VEDIC mathematics. Android Studio is globally available for making android apps. But we are using Unity 3D as it is simpler with less code and also is more powerful to make interactive environments which kids like and so on.</p>
					</ul>
			<h3><strong>Scope:</strong></h3>
					<ul>
						<p>Following are the features in the scope.</p>
						<li>Unity3d installation.</li>
						<li>Used various technologies like C Sharp, Illustrator, Photoshop, 3DSMax, V-ray, After effects, Substance painter and Designer, Cine-Machine etc.</li>
						<li>Support multiple Platform like Windows, Web and Android.</li>

				<h1><strong>System Analysis</strong></h1>
						
				<h4><strong>Study of Existing Solution:</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						
						<p>In the Current Apps, there are many apps available in PlayStore.</p>
						
					</ul>
					
				<h4><strong>Limitations of Existing Solution:</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						
						<p>The problem in the existing System is that it is not very reliable, there are also a lot of educational apps in market for educational purpose. Our app’s focus has a strong connection to the KIDS which are bad at mathematics. Also one of the most important subject is mathematics itself. We are going to enhance learning basic by Starting from basics and to higher level like VEDIC mathematics.</p>
					</ul>		
				
				
				<h4><strong>Functional Requirements:</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						<p>Functional requirements define the internal workings of the software i.e. the calculations, technical details, data manipulation and processing and other specific functionality that show how the use cases are to be satisfied.</p>
						
							<p>The functional requirements of the application are mentioned as follows:</p>
							<li>There should be main menu in the app.</li>
							<li>Thereby though navigating main menu user can choose the correct option required for their convenience.</li>
							<li>There are several scenes for A-Z & 1-10 characters. Afterwards basic mathematics, shapes, operations and symbols for understanding.</li>
							<li>There will be mathematics game like quiz for all operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and their combination.</li>
							<li>Then there will be Basic Vedic mathematics operation for computing operations hastily.</li>
							<li>There will be version of app in VR/AR.</li>
						
					</ul>
					
				<h4><strong>System Workflow (Activity Diagram):</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						
						<p>To use Educational App, it’s just like a normal Android app. Firstly there is main menu with several options. Selecting Play will directly open the first level. There is also option of selecting levels as per users understanding of mathematics. There is settings option where user can change graphics and Audio of the App. Lastly there is close button to quit the app. In any level there is back and next button to move to respective level. There is also home button to jump to main menu.</p>

				<h3><strong>Screen Layout:</strong></h4>
					<ul>
						<h5><strong>1.	Scene View</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>The Scene view is your interactive view into the world you are creating. You will use the Scene view to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of Game Object. Being able to Select, manipulate and modify objects in the Scene view are some of the first skills you must learn to begin working in Unity.</p>

							</div> 
						</ul>
						
						
						<h5><strong>2.	Game View</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>The Game View is rendered from the Camera(s) in your game. It is representative of your final, published game. You will need to use one or more Cameras to control what the player actually sees when they are playing your game. For more information about Cameras, please view the Camera Component page.</p>

							<div><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Game View</strong> </p></div>
				
							</div> 
						</ul>
						
						
						<h5><strong>3.	Project Menu</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>The left panel of the browser shows the folder structure of the project as a hierarchical list. When a folder is selected from the list by clicking, its contents will be shown in the panel to the right. You can click the small triangle to expand or collapse the folder, displaying any nested folders it contains. Hold down Alt while you click to expand or collapse any nested folders recursively. The individual assets are shown in the right hand panel as icons that indicate their type (script, material, sub-folder, etc.). The icons can be resized using the slider at the bottom of the panel; they will be replaced by a hierarchical list view if the slider is moved to the extreme left. The space to the left of the slider shows the currently selected item, including a full path to the item if a search is being performed. Above the project structure list is a Favorites section where you can keep frequently-used items for easy access. You can drag items from the project structure list to the Favorites and also save search queries there (see Searching below). Just above the panel is a “breadcrumb trail” that shows the path to the folder currently being viewed. The separate elements of the trail can be clicked for easy navigation around the folder hierarchy. When searching, this bar changes to show the area being searched (the root Assets folder, the selected folder or the Asset Store) along with a count of free and paid assets available in the store, separated by a slash. There is an option in the General section of Unity’s Preferences window to disable the display of Asset Store hit counts if they are not required.</p>

							</div> 
						</ul>
						
						
						<h5><strong>4.	Hierarchy Window</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>The Hierarchy window contains a list of every GameObject (referred to in this guide as an “object”) in the current Scene. Some of these are direct instances of Asset files (like 3D models), and others are instances of Prefabs, which are custom objects that make up most of your game. As objects are added and removed in the Scene, they will appear and disappear from the Hierarchy as well. By default, objects are listed in the Hierarchy window in the order they are made. You can re-order the objects by dragging them up or down, or by making them “child” or “parent” objects (see below).</p>

							</div> 
						</ul>
						
						<h5><strong>5.	Inspector Window</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>Projects in the Unity Editor are made up of multiple GameObjects that contain scripts, sounds, Meshes, and other graphical elements such as Lights. The Inspector window (sometimes referred to as “the Inspector”) displays detailed information about the currently selected GameObject, including all attached components and their properties, and allows you to modify the functionality of GameObjects in your Scene. Use the Inspector to view and edit the properties and settings of almost everything in the Unity Editor, including physical game items such as GameObjects, Assets, and Materials, as well as in-Editor settings and preferences. When you select a GameObject in either the Hierarchy or Scene view, the Inspector shows the properties of all components and Materials of that GameObject. Use the Inspector to edit the settings of these components and Materials.</p>

							</div> 
						</ul>
						
						<h5><strong>6.	Asset Store</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>The Unity Asset Store is home to a growing library of free and commercial Assets created both by Unity Technologies and also members of the community. A wide variety of Assets is available, covering everything from Textures, Models and animations to whole Project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. You can access the Assets from a simple interface built into the Unity Editor which allows you to download and import Assets directly into your Project.

						<h5><strong>7.	Unity Recorder</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>Use the Unity Recorder to capture and save in-game data during Play Mode. For example, use the Unity Recorder to capture and save gameplay as an MP4 file. A recorder specifies details for creating a recording, including a data source, resolution, and output format. The Unity Recorder package includes the following recorders: Animation Recorder: generates an animation clip in ANIM format. Movie Recorder: generates a video in MP4 or WebM format. Image Recorder: generates a sequence of image files in JPEG, PNG, or OpenEXR format. GIF Recorder: generates an animated GIF file. The Unity Recorder also supports Timeline. Use Recorder tracks and clips to trigger recording sessions from Timeline instances.</p>

						<h5><strong>9.	Animator</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>Unity has a rich and sophisticated animation system (sometimes referred to as ‘Mecanim’). It provides:</p>
							<li>Easy workflow and setup of animations for all elements of Unity including objects, characters, and properties.</li>
							<li>Support for imported animation clips and animation created within Unity</li>
							<li>Humanoid animation</li>
							<li>retargeting</li>
							<li>The ability to apply animations from one character model onto another.</li>
							<li>Simplified workflow for aligning animation clips.</li>
							<li>Convenient preview of animation clips, transitions and interactions between them. This allows animators to work more independently of programmers, prototype and preview their animations before gameplay code is hooked in.</li>
							<li>Management of complex interactions between animations with a visual programming tool.</li>
							<li>Animating different body parts with different logic.</li>
							<li>Layering and masking features</li>

						<h5><strong>10.	 Timeline</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>Use Unity’s Timeline to create cinematic content, game-play sequences, audio sequences, and complex particle effects.</p>
							<li>Each cut-scene, cinematic, or game-play sequence that you create with Unity’s Timeline consists of a Timeline Asset and a Timeline instance</li>
							<li>The Timeline Editor window creates and modifies Timeline Assets and Timeline instances simultaneously.</li>
							<li>The Timeline Overview section includes details on the relationship between the Timeline Editor Window, Timeline Assets, and Timeline instances.</li>
							<li>The Timeline Workflows section shows how to create Timeline Assets and Timeline instances, how to record basic animation, and how to create cinematics.</li>

						</ul>
						
						<h5><strong>11.	 Particle System</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>In a 3D game, most characters, props and scenery elements are represented as meshes, while a 2D game uses sprites for these purposes. Meshes and sprites are the ideal way to depict “solid” objects with a well-defined shape. There are other entities in games, however, that are fluid and intangible in nature and consequently difficult to portray using meshes or sprites. For effects like moving liquids, smoke, clouds, flames and magic spells, a different approach to graphics known as particle systems can be used to capture the inherent fluidity and energy. This section explains Unity’s particle systems and what they can be used for.</p>

							</div> 
						</ul>
						
						<h5><strong>12.	 Scripts</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>The behavior of GameObjects is controlled by the Components that are attached to them. Although Unity’s built-in Components can be very versatile, you will soon find you need to go beyond what they can provide to implement your own gameplay features. Unity allows you to create your own Components using scripts. These allow you to trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like.</p>
							<p>Unity supports the C# programming language natively. C# (pronounced C-sharp) is an industry-standard language similar to Java or C++.</p>
							<p>In addition to this, many other .NET languages can be used with Unity if they can compile a compatible DLL - see here for further details.</p>
						</ul>
						
						<h5><strong>13.	 Audio</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>A game would be incomplete without some kind of audio, be it background music or sound effects. Unity’s audio system is flexible and powerful. It can import most standard audio file formats and has sophisticated features for playing sounds in 3D space, optionally with effects like echo and filtering applied. Unity can also record audio from any available microphone on a user’s machine for use during gameplay or for storage and transmission.</p>

						<h5><strong>15.	 Google VR</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>Google VR is the technology behind both Google Daydream and Google Cardboard VR platforms. Google VR encompasses support for smartphones, head mounted viewers and controllers, standalone head mounted displays and applications. Google VR provides an SDK for Unity that allows you to build VR content for this rich ecosystem of devices.</p>
							<p>Google VR technologies includes Daydream, a platform for high quality mobile VR and Cardboard, built for bite-size VR experiences and 360 video. Daydream consists of Daydream-ready phones, headsets, controllers and experiences and supports high-end Android mobile devices through Daydream. See the full list of Daydream devices on the Google VR) website. Cardboard works with almost any smartphone on both iOS and Android.</p>
							<p>Google Cardboard is the most accessible mobile VR solution, allowing anyone with an iOS or Android smartphone to experience VR apps. Cardboard does have minimum and recommended requirements for its usage, but these are much less hardware-bound than Daydream, focusing mainly on the operating system and basic control systems (such as the gyroscope). Users can view VR apps with an official Google Cardboard viewing device, or a third-party VR viewing device which supports Google VR content (See Hardware and Software Requirements section). Cardboard also supports a range of third-party handheld controllers, for apps which require more complex interactions.</p>
							<p>Daydream allows more feature-rich experiences than Cardboard, but only supports Daydream ready devices such as Daydream-ready phones, built for VR with high-resolution displays, smooth graphics and high fidelity sensors for precise head tracking. Daydream phone apps are accessible with the Daydream View, Google’s headset and motion controller for experiencing high quality VR, using a Daydream-ready phone. Daydream will also support a Daydream Standalone HMD built by original design manufacturers. Daydream Standalone is an untethered head mounted display running on the Android OS including richer controller input and motion tracking.</p>

				<h1><strong>Limitations & Future Enhancements</strong></h1>
						
				<h5><strong>Limitations:</strong></h5>
					<ul>
						
						<li>Android Version should be greater than 6.0</li>
						<li>UI are not that great</li>
						<li>UI problems in AR/VR app</li>
						<li>Audio for all the scenes are not available.</li>
						<li>VR app requires lot of memory</li>
						<li>AR app supports only few character images.</li>
					</ul>
					
				<h4><strong>Future Enhancements:</strong></h4>
				<p>As the “Educational App” is a premium app, features are decided on the basis of client requirements. So there is a constant flow of requirements and enhancements by users from all over the world.</p>
				
					<ul>
						<p>We can propose enhancement like:</p>
						<li>Add support of the app in other Language</li>
						<li>Add functionality of audio in other Language.</li>
						<li>More User friendly UI.</li>
						<li>Multiple sites can be added under app.</li>
						<li>AR app working on website.</li>
					</ul>		
				
				<br>
				<h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
					
					<h5><strong>Self-Analysis of Project Viabilities:</strong></h5>
							<ul>
								<p>The Functionalities of “Educational App” have been developed following all customer requirements and has been delivered after thorough code review and testing. I Believe that all the functionalities will serve the purpose developed for and will be helpful for the users to get better in Mathematics and learn some new techniques to make mathematics more enjoyable to learn. Also using AR/VR app the user will find amusement and enjoyment with learning.</p>
							</ul>
					<h5><strong>Problems Encountered and their Solutions:</strong></h5>
							<ul>
								<p>During the course of training at HariSkyline for the project “Educational App” various problems were faced while implementation.</p>
								<li>Changing User Requirements User requirements changed many times leading to rework of the feature.</li>
								<li>Understanding Unity Scripting Unity Scripting in C Sharp was absolutely new concept. So learning it took way too amount of time</li>
								<li>It was a challenge as my knowledge of the tools and technologies used in the project was the beginner level.</li>
								<li>Designing Models in various software was troublesome and sometimes erroneous increasing the overall making time.</li>
								<li>UI changes were the most changed item in the project.</li>
								<li>VR was not working on the first time. We solved by making video of the actual project and then transferring to Unity.</li>
								<li>AR was not working great for some character images. So we used complex image data for the same.   </li>
								
							</ul>
							
					
					<h5><strong>Summary of Project Work:</strong></h5>
							<ul>
								<p>After the successful implementation of “Educational App” during the entire course of training at HariSkyline, We got the understanding of various tools and technologies including,</p>
								<li>Unity</li>
								<li>Illustrator</li>
								<li>C Sharp</li>
								<li>Photoshop</li>
								<li>3DSMax</li>
								<li>After effects</li>
								<li>Substance painter and Designer </li>
								<li>Paint 3D</li>
								<p>During implementation, we also came to know about industry standard DevOps tools like JIRA, Confluence, Bamboo and Bitbucket provided by Atlassian by using them in the project.</p>
								<p>During training and development, we got familiar with actual in and out of the Agile model, and how to deal with constantly and rapidly changing requirements since so many stakeholders were involved in the project.</p>
								<p>I am now also familiar with industry standards for coding.</p>
